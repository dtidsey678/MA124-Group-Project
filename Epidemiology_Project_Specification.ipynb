    "#### Background\n",
    "Epidemiological models are increasingly used during infectious disease outbreaks to make outbreak projections and to guide control interventions. This project involves developing simple computational models of outbreaks and using them to predict the effects of different interventions. It also involves using stochastic epidemiological models (models that include randomness) to predict the risk that early cases at the beginning of an outbreak lead on to a major epidemic (with a large number of cases) as opposed to fade out as a minor outbreak (with a small number of cases). \n",

Estimating the risk from invading pathogens using practical definitions of a severe epidemic\" by Thompson, Gilligan and Cunniffe (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rsif.2020.0690). The key difference between the stochastic SIR model and the stochastic SIS model is that, in the stochastic SIS model, individuals go back into the $S$ compartment when they recover (rather than entering the $R$ compartment). Pick either the \"Final size\" or \"Duration\" definition of a severe epidemic described in that paper, and write code to reproduce the relevant figure from that article using model simulations (either Fig 4a or Fig 4b; n.b. you are only required to reproduce the solid lines in the chosen figure). Hint: You do not have to simulate the model until $I$ hits zero to make this figure - that might take a very long time. Instead, you can stop each simulation as soon as the relevant maximum value on the x-axis is exceeded (or when $I$ hits zero, if that occurs first).\n",
